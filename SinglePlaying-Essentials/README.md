# Single Player Essentials

This is my selection for mods that I want to use for doing single player play through, 
even with vanilla like style. These mods do help on (in vanilla still really annoying) 
daily tasks, without changing the game or the difficulty.

I provide slightly adjusted configs with these, since I found changing some default settings helpful:
* EAQS -> changing hotkey from "z" to "c", so you get all 3 next to each other (btw: make sure to change 
  the vanilla hotkey setting for toggling auto-pickup from "v" to some other key)
* [Productivity mod pack](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/ProductivityPack/)
* SeedTotem -> increased space requirement to not waste seeds into unhealthy plants, changed 
  increase/decrease radius hotkeys to "Equals" and "Slash"
* Bigger boat exploration radius -> set radius to 250m
* Health and stamina regeneration improved
* Carry weight skill
* Replacing forsaken power with a combined active and passive variant

## Other recommended mods

* [Single Player Base](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/SinglePlayer_Base/) 
  * another mod pack with some features I personally like
* [Regenerative Nature](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/RegenerativeNature/)
  * using [SpawnThat](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ASharpPen/Spawn_That/) to respawn natural resources
  like tin and some trees and rare seeds
* [No Skill Drain](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/NoSkillDrain/) 
  * on death your gained skills aren't lowered
* [Item Configs for CLLC](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/CreatureLeveLAndLootControl_itemconfig/)
  * this mod added ItemConfig*.yml files for
    [CLLC](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/CreatureLevelAndLootControl/) mod
* [Loot tables for EpicLoot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/EpicLoot_HaertAndHome_LootTables/)
  * adds loot tables for [EpicLoot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/RandyKnapp/EpicLoot/) mod since the
  author didn't push full updates adding all new items and creatures, yet
* [Reworked enchants for EpicLoot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/EpicLoot_reworked_enchants/)
  * adds enchanting recipes and available enchants for
  [EpicLoot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/RandyKnapp/EpicLoot/) mod since the author created a lot enchants
  that don't make too much sense for me and I added some more handy recipes.

  * build, craft, ... from containers
