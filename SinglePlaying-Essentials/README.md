# Single Player Essentials

This is my selection for mods that I want to use for doing single player play throughs, even with vanilla like style.
These mods do help on (in vanilla still really annoying) daily tasks, without changing the game or the difficulty.

I provide slightly adjusted configs with these, since I found changing some default settings helpful:
* EAQS -> changing hotkey from "z" to "c", so you get all 3 next to each other (btw: make sure to change the vanilla hotkey setting for toggling auto-pickup from "v" to some other key)
* CFC -> increased radius and turned Round Log on for being put into Kiln, etc.
* SeedTotem -> increased space requirement to not waste seeds into unhealthy plants, changed increase/decrease radius hotkeys to "Equals" and "Slash"
* Bigger boat exploration radius -> set radius to 250m
