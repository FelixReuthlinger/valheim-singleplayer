# Single Player Base

This mod pack does add some of the most basic mods that change playing the game:
1. Create Level and Loot Control (CLLC) -> adds harder creatures
2. Epic Loot (EL) -> enchanted loot
3. Dual Wield (DW) -> let's you use same weapons both handed
4. Regenerative Nature (RN) -> re-spawns trees and tin rocks
5. Better Wards -> to protect your warded bases better from creature attacks and enable unlimited fire sources

The configuration provided for these mods in this modpack remains pretty simple, the only bigger change is that
CLLC's item config is activated and item's configuration is slightly changed, like weight and items that are kept on death.

## Other recommended mods

Here is a list of other mods / mod packs I created and like to use myself for single player (but those could also be 
used on servers, if the server admins install them):
* [Single Player Essentials](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/SinglePlayer_Essentials/) 
  * another mod pack with some features I personally like
* [Regenerative Nature](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/RegenerativeNature/)
  * using [SpawnThat](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ASharpPen/Spawn_That/) to respawn natural resources
    like tin and some trees and rare seeds
* [No Skill Drain](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/NoSkillDrain/)
  * on death your gained skills aren't lowered
* [Item Configs for CLLC](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/CreatureLeveLAndLootControl_itemconfig/)
  * this mod added ItemConfig*.yml files for
    [CLLC](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/CreatureLevelAndLootControl/) mod
* [Loot tables for EpicLoot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/EpicLoot_HaertAndHome_LootTables/)
  * adds loot tables for [EpicLoot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/RandyKnapp/EpicLoot/) mod since the
    author didn't push full updates adding all new items and creatures, yet
* [Reworked enchants for EpicLoot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/EpicLoot_reworked_enchants/)
  * adds enchanting recipes and available enchants for
    [EpicLoot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/RandyKnapp/EpicLoot/) mod since the author created a lot enchants
    that don't make too much sense for me and I added some more handy recipes.
* [Productivity mod pack](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/ProductivityPack/)
  * build, craft, ... from containers
  * improving smelter, kiln and furnace base values
